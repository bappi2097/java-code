Consider that you have been hired to design and develop a university management 
system. For the first version of the system, you are required to store the 
information of all the Teachers, Students, Staff and Courses. For Teachers, 
Students and Staff you must store first name, last name, department and age. 
Teachers and staff also have Employee Id and monthly salary. Student has 
Student Id and Course information that he has enrolled. A course has course 
title, course code, total enrolled student and total credit hours.A course 
has assigned to a course teachers and when a student is enrolled in a course 
then number of enrolled student increased. Need to calculate Teachers and 
Staff yearly salary and Teachers has 10% bonus and staff has 5% bonus. We also 
need to know that how many students are enrolled to a specific subject and 
Total credit hours is taken by a Specific teaches.
