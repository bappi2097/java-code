some information like product’s id, name, and price and product availability (true/false),
customer’s name, id, address and salesperson’s name and id are stored. All customers need to pay 2% tax 
on the total value of their purchase. There are two types of customers-regular customer and member customer. 
Member customers get 5% discount on the total purchased value. When a customer buys a product, 
the product availability is checked before that.
